      <h1 class="playfair b lh-title mv0 pv3">"Soon I traded my pressed work blouses for oversized sweaters and comfortable T-shirts. I didn’t try to cover when the washing machine beeped, the neighbor’s dog barked or my son yelled, “Mom, are you done? It’s lunchtime!” I felt freer with my patients, going places we hadn’t ventured before. Letting go might be easier while wrapped in a cozy blanket on your old armchair, sipping tea from your favorite mug. We therapists try to make our offices feel like safe spaces, but the safest space might actually be the one our patients have created for themselves: their turf, not ours. But I’m grateful for these remote sessions because they’ve been both an illuminator and an equalizer, breaking down the facades we all construct and highlighting our shared humanity. And in that sense, maybe I’d call them therapy after all."</h1>

Where we explore, cherish blow off steam, experiment and manifest. Playing and teasing. Losing ourselves, wrong or right. We can get lost in the collective, but trying to stay true to ourselves. It should be a place where we can be equal by acknowledging our differences to represent a new reality; but it is a fine line between collective consciousness and this consciousness being disrupted by an angry few. Where we take which is not given to us in the real world; the nuance, the in-between. Between reality and imagination." </em>

     Sociologists recognize that people do a lot of unseen work to make sure that our interactions with others go as we wish them to. Much of that work is about agreeing to or challenging what sociologists call "the definition of the situation." Aligning action is any behavior that indicates to others the acceptance of a particular definition of the situation, while a realigning action is an attempt to change the definition of the situation.</h1>
