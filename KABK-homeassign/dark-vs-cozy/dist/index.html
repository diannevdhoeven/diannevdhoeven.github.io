<h2>The Dark Web</h2>
<p>The “darkness” above the darkweb is missing publicly visible activity. Activity might appear there in collapsed societies with no state power, where underworld elements can brazenly wander about in the light of day, OR in highly open utopian societies where there are no taboos, people leave their doors open, and there is no use for locks. The top left quadrant is basically empty/dark because both pure utopias and dystopias are hard to sustain for longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>There are security concerns and hostile intentions all around, and lots of associated technology like VPNs, stronger-than-passwords security models, etc. In that corner, the corporate deep web morphs into the government-corporate deep-state web of security and law-enforcement agencies, whitehat/blackhat hackers, and then into the dark web proper, of drugs, assassination contracts, and child porn.</p>

<h2>The pick 2-of-3</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa535b03-043c-43a5-9d09-196d998b5120_1324x988.png">

<p>The current governing logic of the extended internet universe, I think, boils down to a pick-2-of-3 constraint triangle: {free, open to the public, quality}.</p>
<p>Can we have all 3? Many idealists think we once had that (we never did, we just had small scale, and it still wasn’t hitting all 3), or that in some hand-wavy way, “true” net neutrality would deliver that (I’m only a very weak defender of net neutrality: it was a useful principle for a while, but it has outlived its utility).

I think we can get closer than we are today though.</p>
<p>That’s the promise of the crypto world (not just cryptocurrencies, but cryptographic technologies in general, starting with private-key based identity and security for everything). It is still at a very rudimentary stage of development. But once it matures, we will see the entire extended internet universe getting rearchitected on better foundations, where we could at least push out the boundary of the 2-of-3 pareto.</p>

<h2>Who Benefits from the Deep Web?
</h2>
<p>There is a wide range of people that benefit from the Deep Web’s capability to allow anonymous use and communication. The following are individuals or groups who have benefitted from the Deep Web in the past and whom also continue to benefit from its existence today:

Journalists and Whistleblowers
Political Protesters, and Anti-Censorship Advocacy Groups
Residents of Oppressive Political Regimes</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2>Journalists and Whistleblowers</h2>
<p>Former military, government, and corporate employees are coming together en masse to report widespread (and largely unknown) corruption within their respective fields. Working in conjunction with investigative reporters, these individuals can communicate top-secret and classified information to the media to expose corruption under a modicum of protection.</p>

<section>
<h2>Political Protesters, and Anti-Censorship Advocacy Groups</h2>
<p>Anonymity is of paramount importance for these figures, who utilize the Dark Web as an application to conduct communication measures safely and privately. </p>

<h2>Residents of Oppressive Political Regimes</h2>
<p>Citizens living in countries ruled by oppressive regimes often do not have ready access to news, information, and critically important data pertaining to the health and sustainability of society as a collective whole. The Deep Web offers members of society living under oppressive political regimes a relatively safe way to garner crucial information for their own needs, in addition to exporting it out of the country. </p>

<h2>Digital Resting Points break the feed </h2>
<p>The digital resting point entered my Instagram Stories experience about a year ago. Artist, meme-maker, and hesitant influencer Gabi Abrão, @sighswoon, started posting iPhone videos of west-coast nature — swaying palm trees, heavy rain, a lapping ocean — accompanied by “congratulations!” or “something has happened! you’ve reached a digital resting point.” Typically there aren’t people in the frame, making it easier for the viewer to place themselves within the image. There aren’t even objects. They are filterless. Users soon adopted her words to caption their own scenes of analog life.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb88edb06-00d0-4002-a35d-46accd47d29e_1786x1370.png" alt="alternatetext">
<p>@sighswoon is a special account because Abrão is self-aware about the internet illusion. Her most viral post is a guide to having a positive experience on Instagram. She doesn’t think that you are “a mindless endorphin-chasing idiot for enjoying your phone time.” More than 82,000 accounts have saved that slideshow. I interpret it as an invitation to be your own curator of an activity the average person spends 53 minutes a day doing (and that stat is from 2018). </p>

<h2>a 'Wii' Break</h2>
<p>What these videos of geographically placeless water, sky, and sand most remind me of is the pop-up that appeared every 45 minutes on Nintendo’s Wii Sports: “Why not take a break?” under a line drawing of a window flung open to reveal a patch of aqua blue, with the remote left behind on the table. It’s hard to imagine any kid took the suggestion to heart, compelled by an empty idea of the outside world where there are no cheering Mii fans or a bowling alley within walking distance.</p> </section>

<p>On the occasions that I encounter a digital resting point, I really do put down my phone, though for a cynical reason. While the caption demands an interlocutor, the video functions in a typical FOMO way. Its creator is resting at a waterfall and I am definitely not. The irony of someone going on Instagram (from a place that looks like it doesn’t have phone reception) to give me permission to log off is so annoying that it works!</p>

<h2>Why are so many brands inclined to coziness?</h2>
<p>Marketers have always used beautiful domestic spaces in advertisements. Now even shoes and liquor are supposed to make us feel safe and warm.</p>
<p>Selling the idea of coziness is easy when you’re selling blankets. But over the past few years cool, aspirational brands — Hims vitamins, Madewell tote bags, Glossier skin care — have been marketed with the same aesthetic of homey comfort, with retro photography, adorable founder backstories, or Instagram memes about staying home surrounded with your candles on a Friday night.

This isn’t some paradigm-altering concept; people have been using beautiful domestic spaces in ad campaigns since branding immemorial. What does feel new is the marketing of coziness to a generation defined by their desire for it. Self-care, hygge, and newer terms like “domestic cozy” are all means of marketing to a group of cool young people who, even when they’re not at home, want to feel like it.</p>

<h2>Tvenkatesh Rao: Coining of the Term</h2>
<p> Tvenkatesh Rao is a writer and educator who to my knowledge, first coined the term 'cozy web'. He highlights that unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot. It lives in a high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.
Public and cozy are just two of the dozens of distinctly different flavors of internet around today.</p>
<p>More and more civilian online activity is sinking into the cozyweb. It doesn’t have a good interconnection fabric (ie, it’s all about the sophistication of cut-and-paste). It has better boundary/gatekeeping technology (administration, kicking users out) than linking technology. The cut-and-paste-and-screenshot protocol could use some good, deeper productization.

Apparently, Japan has already been down this road (ht Adam Elkus) with people retreating from the public internet to the cozy internet.

The cozynet is not the same as waldenponding, since it remains connected and online and isn’t concerned about distraction or overuse of digital media. It just retreats from public view/activity for various reasons ranging from simple preference for privacy and small communities to fear and PTSD.</p>
